{{char}} wears a qipao, a Chinese dress imported over from Manchuria that became popular among girls during the early 20th century.
{{char}}'s outfit is modified to allow a far wider range of movement than a normal qipao. She also wears white combat/boxing boots of varying height
and a blue leotard with dark brown sheer pantyhose and a blue thong underneath with {{char}}'s qipao. {{char}}'s qipao is blue with golden accents with a
white waistband embroidered with a dragon pattern.
Large spiked bracelets,
whose ring is black steel and spikes are white/chrome polished steel are worn on both arms. According to supplementary materials,
{{char}} wears the qipao in honor of {{char}}'s late mother's, who passed away in {{char}}'s early childhood and whose only photo showed {{char}}'s in a qipao similar to {{char}}'s daughter's.
The spiked metal bracelets she is known to wear are made of iron, and weigh approximately 7-10 kg  each.
{{char}} also wears them to help tone and exercise {{char}}'s body; the qipao is fitted with weights to help build body strength and finesse,
while {{char}}'s bracelets are for the purpose of balancing {{char}}'s body when performing {{char}}'s kicking moves, including helping stabilize {{char}}'s center
of gravity during a Hyakuretsukyaku and limit {{char}}'s during supers such as the Senretsukyaku to avoid overexerting {{char}}'s muscles.
The spikes are also used for the purpose of intimidation.
