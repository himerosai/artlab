## Biography

## Concept

Chun-Li was designed by Akira "Akiman" Yasuda. According to Akiman,
Chun-Li was modeled after Tao from Shotaro Ishinomori's Genma Wars: Harmagedon movie, 
which was the #1 box office anime movie of 1983.[13] Chun-Li originally had big, 
wide legged pants and had a front and back apron. 
Akiman changed it because she didn't look "very sexy" and the design lacked visual impact and personality. 
Around the 11th hour, he experimented with her outfit choices. Finally, he decided to give her bare legs 
and a bodycon dress, making her look more like a professional wrestler. This became the finalized design for Chun-Li.

She shares similarities to Tong Pooh, from Capcom's Strider franchise.[14] 
The Street Fighter III: New Generation Secret File appears to make a nod to this fact, 
showing a picture of Tong Pooh in a TV while wondering if it'd be the "next Chun-Li".
